<h2>What is Data Science?</h2>

<p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or 
unstructured,[1][2] which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics,
[3] similar to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD).ata science employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, 
statistics, operations research,[4] information science, and computer science, including signal processing, probability models, machine learning, statistical learning, 
data mining, database, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, predictive analytics, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, data compression, 
computer programming, artificial intelligence, and high performance computing. Methods that scale to big data are of particular interest in data science, although the discipline is not 
generally considered to be restricted to such big data, and big data technologies are often focused on organizing and preprocessing the data instead of analysis.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Care About It</h2>

<p> With over a million jobs that need to be filled by 2018 data science seems to have a bright future. Why? primarily because of <a href="http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/what-is-big-data.html" target="_blank">Big Data</a>.
	Many companies are going to need professionals who know how to gather, extract, manipulate, and make sense of the gigantic amounts of data being collected. Evrey area of our econonmy now has access to more 
	data than any other time in history. Whether it's coming up with a way to predict what next years logistical costs might be or quantify when the best times to buy and sell on the stock market may be, data scienctists  
	make this data sensible and readily available. Also, data scientists make a very good salary ranging from 70k to 150k because of the value they bring to these organizatons that need to make sense of their data.</p>

<h2>Different Type of Data Scientists</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Data Scientists and Statistics</strong>: You'll be engaging in Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), data visualization and quantitative research</li>
	<li><strong>Data Scientist and Mathmatics</strong>: If you know how to apply mathmatics in order to solve real world problems it will help you with inventory management, forecasting, creating and manipulating pricing algorithms
				supply chain data manipulation, creating quality control mechanisms and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Engineer</strong>: Where data scientists spend most of their time synthesizing and leveraging massive datasets to identify and prioritize data for various analytic purposes. Data Engineers
				build and manaage information by implementing and or creating data handling tools to enhance infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Scientist & Machine Learning</strong>: Data Scientists that focuse on the machine learning aspect of this discipline develope algorithms used to extract data patterns, forecast inventory management,
				strengthen supply chain networks, and suggest pricing strategies.</li>
</ul>
